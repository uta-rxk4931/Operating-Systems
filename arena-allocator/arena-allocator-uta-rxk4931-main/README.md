# Arena-Allocator-Assignment

## Memory Allocation with malloc()

In the glibc malloc() implementation malloc()either invokes either brk() or mmap () syscall to obtain memory.

While this implementation works fine for most applications applications with performance needs, e.g. games, aircraft, spacecraft, etc. can not afford to make a system call every time
an allocation is needed. In these cases a large memory pool or arena is allocated on application startup. The application then manages memory on its own by implementing
its own allocators to handle requests. 
1. You will implement a memory arena allocator that supports First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit and Next Fit algorithms.
2. You must also benchmark your four implementations of an allocator against the standard system call malloc(). Design and develop a program and capture execution
time for your four implementations of the arena allocator and compare their performance against malloc().
3. The results of your benchmarking will be written in a report detailing your findings.

The code you submit for this assignment will be verified against a database consisting of kernel source, github code, stackoverflow, previous student’s submissions and other
internet resources. Code that is not 100% your own code will result in a grade of 0 and referral to the Office of Student Conduct.

## Important Warning

This program involves a lot of pointers and pointer arithmetic. You will seg fault your code if you are not careful with your pointers. Verify ALL pointers pointers before you
dereference them.
Bad: 
```
if ( ptr -> next )
```
Good: 
```
if( ptr && ptr->next )
```
You will need to use gdb to find and fix your pointers errors.

## Your Memory Allocator API

Your memory allocator must implement the following four functions:
```
int memalloc_init( size_t size, enum ALGORITHM algorithm )
```
This function will use malloc to allocate a pool of memory that is size bytes big. If the size parameter is less than zero then return -1. If allocation fails return -1. If the
allocation succeeds return 0. This is the only malloc() your code will call. Size must be 4-byte aligned. You are provided a macro ALIGN4 to perform this
alignment.

The second parameter will set which algorithm you will use to allocate memory from your pool. The enumerated value is:
```
enum ALGORITHM
{
  NEXT_FIT = 0,
  BEST_FIT,
  WORST_FIT,
  FIRST_FIT
}; 
```
```
void *memalloc_alloc( size_t size )
```
This function will allocate size bytes from your preallocated memory arena using the heap allocation algorithm that was specified during memalloc_init. This function
returns a pointer to the memory on success and NULL on failure.

```
void memalloc_free( void * pointer )
```
This function will free the block pointed to by the pointer. This function returns no value. If there are two consecutive blocks free then combine (coalesce) them. Do not
call free( ) for this. This should return the block back to your area.

```
void memalloc_destroy( )
```
This function will free the allocated arena and empty the linked list This is the only free() that your code will call.

```
int memalloc_size( )
```
This function will return the number of nodes in the memory area linked list.

## Tracking Your Memory

You will keep a ledger to maintain a list of allocated and free memory segments of your memory pool, where a segment is either allocated to a process or is an empty hole
between two allocations. Your ledger should be implemented as a linked list using an array and not use dynamic memory allocations.

```
struct Node
{
   size_t size;
   enum TYPE type;
   void * arena;
   int next;
   int previous;
};
```

Preallocate the memory for your ledger in your memalloc_init function. Assume a maximum of 10000 allocations.
Each entry in the list specifies a hole (H) or process allocation (P), the address at which it starts, the length, and a pointer to the next item.

For example, after the user initializes your memory allocator with:
```
memalloc_init( 65535, FIRST_FIT );
```
Then you will have a single node in your linked list specifying a hole, at the starting address, a length of 65535, and a next pointer of NULL.
If the user then requests a memory allocation as:
```
memalloc_alloc( 5000 );
```
you will then have a linked list with the first node specifying a process allocation (P), a pointer to the starting address, a length of 5000, and a next pointer pointing to the next
node which is a hole (H), pointing to the starting address plus 5000, a length of 60535,and a next pointer of NULL.

Your list will be kept sorted by address. Sorting this way has the advantage that when a allocation is released.

## Aligning Memory Requests

All memory allocations must be word-aligned. You must use the following #define in
your code:

```
#define ALIGN4(s) (((((s) - 1) >> 2) << 2) + 4)
```
When the user requests a size of memory you must pass it through that macro to ensure that the request is 4-byte aligned. For example, your void *memalloc_alloc( size_t size )function must treat
the parameter size as:

```
void *memalloc_alloc( size_t size )
{
size_t requested_size = ALIGN4( size );
// allocate requested_size according to the selected algorithm
```

Your allocator will then allocate a memory block of requested_size number of bytes.

## Building the Code

A Makefile is provided so to build the code type: 
```
make
```
## Non-Functional Requirements

- Tabs or spaces shall be used to indent the code. Your code must use one or the other. All indentation must be consistent.
- No line of code shall exceed 100 characters.
- All code must be well commented. This means descriptive comments that tell the intent of the code, not just what the code is executing. When in doubt over comment your code.
- Keep your curly brace placement consistent. If you place curly braces on a new line , always place curly braces on a new end. Don’t mix end line brace placement with new line
brace placement.
- Remove all extraneous debug output before submission. The only output shall be the output of the unit tests and your benchmark programs.

## Unit Tests

There are 20 unit tests that will help you debug your code. They are contained in main.c in the repo. After building the code with make you can run the tests by
typing:
```
./unit_tests
```
There will be 20 test cases with each test case being worth 2.5% of the total grade. When a unit test fails the assert message will tell you what
assert didn’t pass. You can then look at the unit test and a comment before the assert will tell you what part of your functionality broke the code. In the screenshot below, if the
assert on line 18 killed your program, you can read the comment on line 17 that tells you the memalloc_alloc call on line 13 failed. You would then need to fix memalloc_alloc topass the test.
You may not modify main.c. 50% of your grade for this assignment will come from the unit tests.

## Benchmarking your code

You may use benchmark1.c, benchmark2.c, benchmark3.c, benchmark4.c, and benchmark5.c to create your benchmarks. These programs must be identical with the
exception of the calls to malloc() in one program and the memalloc_init() call in the other four to ensure your comparisons are valid.

You are to determine which implementation is best given your benchmark programs. You must design your code and testing to provide you with enough valid data to allow you to
interpret and report your findings. These programs must be thorough in their behavior and must test a large range of different allocations and edge cases. Benchmarks and
reports which only test a few use cases will result in a loss of significant points on the report.

You must demonstrate enough rigor in your data collection that variations in CPU loading on your system provides a negligible amount of error in your benchmarks. Timings must be collected and presented in units of milliseconds or smaller. Results that are collected in units of seconds will result in 0 points being assigned for the benchmark / report portion of the assignment.

## Report

Your report must start with an executive summary paragraph that succinctly explains your project, the benchmarks, the results of your benchmarks and your conclusion as to which is the best allocation algorithm implementation.

Following the executive summary, explain the purpose of the benchmarks and your benchmark design in detail. Be sure to clearly state the design considerations and strategy used to throughly benchmark the performance of your implementations.

Your data must be presented in a table and graph form. You must provide an interpretation, in text, of your data with enough description and
explanations that a reader will understand the results and understand your conclusions. If there are any anomalous results be sure to note them and provide an explanation as to why they occurred.

After presenting your results follow with your conclusions. Explain, with references back to your data, why your winning algorithm is the best allocation algorithm. References back to the lecture noting that Worst Fit leaves the largest available heap blocks will not be accepted and will result in 0 points for the report. You must have data supporting your conclusion and your interpretation must rely on your data.

### Report Format

Your report must be submitted as a PDF file. Reports that are submitted as Microsoft Word documents, text files, etc. will be worth 0 points. The report must be written with a 12pt Times New Roman typeface with headings in a 16pt Bold Times New Roman typeface.

In the upper right corner of the first page put your name and  student ID number.

## Point Allocations

## Administrative

This assignment must be coded in C. Any other language will result in 0 points. You programs will be compiled and graded on the course container. Please make sure they compile and run in the container before submitting it. Code that does not compile with the provided Makefile will result in a 0.

Your program is to be turned in via pushing your change to main on GitHub. Submission time is determined by the GitHub system time. You may submit your programs as often as you wish. Only your last submission will be graded.  You may use no outside code.

## Academic Integrity

This assignment must be 100% your own work. No code may be copied from friends, previous students, books, web pages, etc. All code submitted is automatically checked against a database of previous semester’s graded assignments, current student’s code and common web sources. By submitting your code on GitHub you are attesting that you have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work. Code that is copied from an external source or used as inspiration, excluding the course github repositories, will result in a 0 for the assignment and referral to the Office of Student Conduct.
